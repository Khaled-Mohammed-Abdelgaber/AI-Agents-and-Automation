**Telegram Bot Workflow for Google Services Integration**

This workflow implements a Telegram bot that seamlessly integrates with various Google services using official Google APIs. The bot is capable of:

1. Accessing your Gmail inbox to read and send emails

2. Managing your Google Calendar, including reading and assigning events

3. Scheduling and organizing Google Meet meetings

4. Interacting with a Google Sheet that stores your contact information

By connecting to these services, the bot enables efficient communication and scheduling directly from Telegram, automating key productivity tasks such as email handling, meeting scheduling, and calendar event management.
